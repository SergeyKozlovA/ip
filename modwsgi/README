In order to have got here you must have checked out all code for the
mod_wsgi project from the trunk of the mod_wsgi source code repository.

The sub directories contained within this directory are as follows:

mod_wsgi - The core Apache module for hosting Python WSGI applications in
conjunction with the Apache web server.

mod_wsgi-docs - Documentation for the mod_wsgi package. This uses Sphinx
and will be posted on "http://readthedocs.org".

mod_wsgi-tests - Tests for the mod_wsgi package. Many of these tests are
generic and could be applied to any WSGI server.

Any official releases of the above packages and corresponding documentation
can be found at 'http://www.modwsgi.org'.
